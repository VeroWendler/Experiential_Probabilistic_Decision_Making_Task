# Experiential_Probabilistic_Decision_Making_Task
Pilot Study on Symbolic/Experiential Neglect. This program is a pilot study to determine the optimal number of conditions and trials to use in the main experiment testing the hypothesis that the experiential neglect observed by Garcia et al. (2022/23) is due to uncertainty in the probability estimation of the experiential  icons.
